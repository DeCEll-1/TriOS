# TriOS

All-in-one Starsector toolkit. Very very early development.

## Tools

- (WIP) **VRAM Estimator**: Now with visualization.
- (TODO) **Chipper**: Logfile viewer.
- (TODO) **StarModder**: Mod database viewer.
- (TODO) **Rules.csv Autoreloader**: Hot reload for your mod rules.csv.
- (TODO) **Mod Manager**: SMOL 2.0.

## Building

You will need to run the following command in a terminal in the project's root folder (I run it in IntelliJ's terminal).

```
dart run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
